# Parakeet

An interpreted, statically typed, lazily evaluated functional programming language. Parakeet is an attempt to learn more about programming languages and interpreters.

## Goal
Parakeet's goal is to be a language with pure functional features while remaining lightweight. Many purely functional languages are hindered by slow compilers and difficult syntax for programmers coming from popular programming languages in other paradigms. Parakeet is designed to be easily picked up by all programmers, whether it is their first functional language or not, while being a good tool for quick iteration.
